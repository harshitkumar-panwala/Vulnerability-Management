# Vulnerability Scanning on Azure VM

This project showcases how to perform vulnerability scanning on a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Azure. A second VM was used as the platform for Nessus Essentials to carry out the scans.

## Documentation

The [Vulnerability Management Documentation](https://github.com/harshitkumar-panwala/Vulnerability-Management/blob/main/Vulnerability%20Management%20Documentation.pdf) provides all the details you need to understand the project. I apologize if some of the screenshots are a bit blurry.

## Nessus Scan Reports

You can find the vulnerability scan reports generated by Nessus Essentials in the [Nessus Scan Reports](https://github.com/harshitkumar-panwala/Vulnerability-Management/tree/main/Nessus%20Scan%20Reports) directory.
