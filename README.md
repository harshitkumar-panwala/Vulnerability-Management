This project showcases how to perform vulnerability scanning on a virtual machine (VM) hosted on Azure. I used a second VM as the platform 
for Nessus Essentials to carry out the scans.

The Vulnerability Management Documentation offers all the details you need to understand the project.
I apologize if some of the screenshots are a bit blurry.

You can find the vulnerability scan reports generated by Nessus Essentials in the 'Nessus Scan Reports' directory.

For deprecated software, like Mozilla Firefox and VLC Media Player, please check the 'Outdated Software' directory.
